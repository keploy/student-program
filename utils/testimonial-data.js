I now have a better understanding of the fundamentals of API development, as well as the latest trends and technologies. \n\n\nThroughout the program, we received mentorship from experienced API developers. They provided invaluable advice and tips for creating robust APIs that are secure and perform well. We also had the opportunity to explore the latest API trends and technologies, such as GraphQL and gRPC.",
